# Solution for mada Assignment RSA

Solution by Dario Breitenstein / Hanna Lisa Franz.

## Outline

- An implementation of the scenarios described in the assignment is in RSACipherTest.
- The Key Generation Algorithm can be found in RSAKeyPair.
- The Mathematical functions and algorithms necessary are provided by RSAUtilities.
- Some simple Unit Tests for those methods are implemented in RSAUtilitiesTest.
- RSAPrivateKey and RSAPublicKey are used to represent keys.
- FileUtilities provide simplified File I/O methods with terrible error handling.
